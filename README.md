# Deepfake-Proof eKYC System

This system is designed to perform identity verification and forgery detection in real-time. The system leverages SCRFD for preprocessing, fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) for deepfake detection, and InsightFace for identity verification through face embedding similarity. The solution is deployed as a user-friendly Streamlit web application supporting both static image uploads and live webcam capture.
